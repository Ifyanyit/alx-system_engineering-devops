#Regular Expression

A regular expression called a "regexp", is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.
 It is mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching (i.e. it operates like a “find and replace” command). While it is a very powerful tool, it is also very dangerous because of its complexity.
