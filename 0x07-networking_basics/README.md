## 0. OSI model

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.

 It  is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:
* The lowest level: layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal.

* The highest level: layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc


## 1-types_of_network
 The types of network includes LAN, WAN and other sub-groups.

## 2-MAC_and_IP_address

Here is about the type of network addresses:
* MAC: Media access card
* IP: Internet protocol

## 3-UDP_and_TCP
Unique datagram protocol and Transmission control protocol

## 4-TCP_and_UDP_ports
I also learned about the ports available

## 5-is_the_host_on_the_network
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a protocol in the Internet protocol suite. It is used by network devices, to check if other network devices are available on the network. The command ping uses ICMP to make sure that a network device remains online or to troubleshoot issues on the network.

Here is a bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
